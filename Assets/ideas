Gameplay:

Combat System:

    Skill and Modifier System:

    Skills: Player collect abilities with different attack patterns (AoE, Projectile, Dot, Melee, etc.)
    Modifiers: Function as upgrades to the ablities making them stroger or adding new effects. (For example: Basic Fireball ability could get a modifier thats splits it into two smaller fireballs or adds a burn/dot effect to it.)

    - Modifies will be gathered after clearing a floor from the chest at the end, Boss fights (better selection of abilities and modifiers), Shop floors and from Treasure floors.
    - Modifiers synergize with each other for instance
        - Fireball + Burn Modifier + Explosive Burn Modifier = damage spread on explosion
        - Lightning Nova + Shock Modifier = Shocks enemies causing them to take more damage.
        - Defensive Shield + Thorn Modifier = deal damage when taking hits
        - Also converting damage to other damage types to use other skills modifiers (Fireball converted to lightning + Shock modifier = shock enemies on hit)
        - Add triggers like "on hit" "on crit" etc. to modifiers.
        - Maybe skills can be combined to create new skills depending on the skill type (fire+wind = fire tornado or something like that idk we will see)

Character Progression:

    Randomness: Ability and modifier options have randomness. Some modifiers and skills will have different rarities.
    Permanent Upgrades/ Meta progression: Player will unlock new abilities, modifiers and characters maybe a perk tree with permanent buffs to all runs.

- The world is like the world in slay the spire where there is multiple paths the player can choose from leading to different fights like bosses, events, shops, treasures and normal floors.
- The player will always run "on rails" automatically moving through the floors.
- Normal floors will have enemies or a group of enemies on set points of the path and a chest at the end wich can be looted for abilities and upgrades.
- Boss floors will be the same but shorter only have the boss in a room with a chest at the end.
- Shop floors will be the same but shorter only have a shop keeper in a room.
- Treasure floors will be the same but shorter only have a chest in a room.
- Event floors im undecided maybe dont make it into the game or will be added later.
